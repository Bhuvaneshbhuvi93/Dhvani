# Defect Detection using Image Comparison

This Python script detects defects in images by comparing them using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). It identifies differences between two images and draws bounding boxes around areas with defects.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- imutils
- scikit-image

Install the required libraries:

```
pip install opencv-python imutils scikit-image
```
