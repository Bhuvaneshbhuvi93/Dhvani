# Defect Detection using Image Comparison

This Python script detects defects in images by comparing them using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). It identifies differences between two images and draws bounding boxes around areas with defects.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- imutils
- scikit-image

Install the required libraries:

```
pip install opencv-python imutils scikit-image
```

# Bee Dynamics Simulation
This Python code simulates the motion of a system in three-dimensional space over time. It models the movement of a "bee" based on a set of differential equations. The resulting trajectories are plotted for analysis.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
SciPy
Matplotlib
## Usage
1.Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

## Code Explanation
plot.ipynb: Contains the Python code for simulating and plotting the bee's motion. It defines the differential equations, sets up the time span and initial conditions, and uses solve_ivp from scipy.integrate for numerical integration.

system(t, variables): Defines the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing the motion of the bee. Modify this function to change the behavior of the system.

t_span: Defines the time span for the integration. Adjust the range as needed.

initial_conditions: Specifies the initial values for x, y, and z at t = 0.
